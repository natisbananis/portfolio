    <h1>About me </h1>
    <p> Hello, my name is Nataly Olivares, I go to Oakland Charter High School. I join Scripted to see if this is the major I want to do in the future, I did somewhat coding in the pass but Scripted helped me learn more. I live in Oakland with my family and work in my family's restaurant on the weekends. My favorite hobbies are to draw, play basketball, and watch animes. I'm just a girl trying out new things before high school ends.   </p>
